How to Wipe a Hard Drive

Back up anything you want to keep, such as photos, software product keys, etc.
Download a free data destruction program. Any of the first six programs we recommend on that list will work great because they can be used to wipe a hard drive from outside of Windows, a necessary feature if you want to wipe the hard drive that Windows is installed on.
Complete whatever steps are necessary to install the software or, in the case of a bootable program like DBAN, get the ISO image on a CD or DVD disc, or a USB device like a flash drive
Wipe the hard drive according to the program's instructions.
After properly wiping a hard drive, you can be confident that whatever information was on the drive is now gone for good.

Microsoft Azure, formerly known as Windows Azure, is Microsoft's public cloud computing platform. It provides a broad range of cloud services, including compute, analytics, storage and networking. Users can pick and choose from these services to develop and scale new applications or run existing applications in the public cloud.

The Azure platform aims to help businesses manage challenges and meet their organizational goals. It offers tools that support all industries -- including e-commerce, finance and a variety of Fortune 500 companies -- and is compatible with open source technologies. This gives users the flexibility to use their preferred tools and technologies. In addition, Azure offers four different forms of cloud computing: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and serverless functions.

Microsoft charges for Azure on a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) basis, meaning subscribers receive a bill each month that only charges them for the specific resources and services they have used.

How does Microsoft Azure work?
Once customers subscribe to Azure, they have access to all the services included in the Azure portal. Subscribers can use these services to create cloud-based resources, such as VMs and databases. Azure resources and services can then be assembled into running environments used to host workloads and store data.

A scripting language (also known as scripting, or script) is a series of commands that can be executed without the need for compiling. While all scripting languages are programming languages, not all programming languages are scripting languages. PHP, Perl, and Python are common examples of scripting languages.
